        title: 'Motor Driven Roller',
        description: `A Motor Driven Roller ( MDR ) is a type of conveyor roller that incorporates an integrated brushless dc motor within the roller body. This design eliminates the need for a separate external drive unit , making it a compact and efficient solution for various material handling and conveyor system applications . Motor driven rollers are commonly used in industries such as manufacturing, distribution and logistics`,
        types: ['MDR 50mm', 'MDR 76mm', 'MDR 80mm'],
        Features: [
            {
                "Built-in Motor": "The motor is tucked away inside the roller itself, making the whole system more compact and simpler. This is unlike traditional conveyor systems that have a separate motor somewhere else.",
                "Runs Quietly": "As the MDR uses a brush-less motor design,  the noise source is eliminated because there is no physical contact between components. The absence of commutator noise contributes to a quieter operation.",
                "Modular and Flexible": "MDR are designed to be modular and easy to install. This modularity allows for flexibility in conveyor system design and layout. It also simplifies maintenance and replacement, as individual motorized rollers can be swapped out without affecting the entire system.",
                "Energy Efficiency with Precision Control": " The use of a brushless DC motor contributes to the energy efficiency of motor drive rollers. These motors can be controlled with precision, optimizing power consumption based on specific load and speed requirements."
